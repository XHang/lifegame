## why do I want to develop the game 
 Human life can be modeled
 Although human's creative are not limited, Yet most people,including me, always do the same things every day.
 so I think I can build a game to simulate the life
 and also, I want to build an experience of different countries,human,character, to simulate the reality. 
 I will study more  ways of living diverse countries, and coding in the game,
 but one person's ability are limited,so if you would like to share your life, I appreciate
